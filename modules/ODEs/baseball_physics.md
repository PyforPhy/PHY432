After implementing a number of
[integrators for ODEs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/ODEs/integrators.md %}) we are now in the position to solve some practical problems:

- [movement with air resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
  modules/ODEs/linear_air_resistance.md %})
- realistic movement of a spinning baseball (this lesson)


## Baseball physics

The major forces acting on a flying baseball are drag (friction due to
air resistance) (see also 11-ODE-baseball.ipynb)

$$
\mathbf{F}_2 = -b_2 v \mathbf{v}
$$

and the Magnus force (when the ball is spinning)

$$
\mathbf{F}_M = \alpha \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}
$$

where $$\boldsymbol{\omega}$$ is the ball's angular velocity in rad/s (e.g., 200/s for a baseball).

For a sphere the proportionality constant $$\alpha$$ can be written

$$
\mathbf{F}_M = \frac{1}{2} C_L \rho A \frac{v}{\omega} \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}
$$

where $$C_L$$ is the lift coefficient, $$\rho$$ the air density, $$A$$ the
ball's cross section. (Advantage of defining $$C_L$$ this way: when spin
and velocity are perpendicular, the Magnus force is simply $$F_M =
\frac{1}{2} C_L \rho A v^2$$.)

$$C_L$$ is mainly a function of the *spin parameter*

$$
S = \frac{r\omega}{v}
$$

with the radius $$r$$ of the ball. In general we write

$$
\mathbf{F}_M = \frac{1}{2} C_L  \frac{\rho A r}{S} \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}
$$

For a baseball, experimental data show approximately a power law dependence of $$C_L$$ on $$S$$

$$
C_L = 0.62 \times S^{0.7}
$$

The **equations of motions** are then

\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} &= \mathbf{v}\\\\\\
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} &= -g \hat{\mathbf{e}}_y -\frac{b_2}{m} v \mathbf{v} + \frac{\alpha}{m}\ \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}
\end{align}

(quadratic drag $$-\frac{b_2}{m} v \mathbf{v}$$ included.)




The lesson showed how

1. to define the physical problem (obtain the trajectory of a baseball
   with spin and air resistance)
2. to derive the underlying equations (Newton's equations of motions
   and the forces acting on the ball)
3. to adapt an algorithm to solve the equations (use RK4 for
   integrating the ODEs and express the problem in ODE standard form
   so that one can use `ode.rk4()`)
4. to visualize and discuss the results (plot trajectories and assess
   the influence of spin)
