After implementing a number of
[integrators for ODEs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link modules/ODEs/integrators.md %}) we are now in the position to solve some practical problems:

- projectile movement with air resistance (this lecture)
- realistic movement of a spinning baseball (next lecture)

## Linear air resistance

For the problem that you should solve during the class, get the
notebook[^1]
[11-ODE-lineardrag-students.ipynb]({{ site.nbviewer.resources }}/11_ODE_applications/11-ODE-lineardrag-students.ipynb)

<!-- 
and see notebook
[11-ODE-lineardrag.ipynb]({{ site.nbviewer.resources }}/11_ODE_applications/11-ODE-lineardrag.ipynb)
for the full solution.[^2]
-->

#### Footnotes



[^1]:

     As usual, `git pull` the resources repository
     [{{ site.resources.shortname }}]({{ site.resources.url }}) to get a
     local copy of the notebook. Then **copy the notebook and all other
     code into your work directory** in order to complete the exercises.

[^2]:

     Notebook will be posted after class; in the meantime look at the
     student notebook.
