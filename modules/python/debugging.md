Code contains errors (also known as
**[bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)** --- literally
the first "bug" was a *moth* stuck in an electromechanical relay of the
Mark II computer).

## Exceptions ##

When Python code fails, it raises an **[Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exceptions)**:

```python
>>> 10 * (1/0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

>>> 4 + spam*3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'spam' is not defined

>>> '2' + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```


## Error handling ##

Some errors cannot be avoided and we our code to handle them
gracefully. This is especially true when handling external inputs.

Python provides the
[try...except](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
statement to handle exceptions.

In the example, we handle
1. incorrect input (detected by a `TypeError`)
2. division by zero

```python
def normalize(data):
   """Normalize numbers in data to range 0...1"""
   
   try:
      xmin = min(data)
      xmax = max(data)
   except TypeError:
      raise TypeError(f"ERROR: data = {data} contains non-numeric input")

   datarange = xmax - xmin
   try:
      normalized_data = [(x - xmin)/datarange for x in data]
   except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Range of data is 0, returning 0")
      normalized_data = [0.0 for x in data]
      
   return normalized_data
```


If you want to raise an exception, use
```python
raise ValueError("Incorrect input for data")
```

Note that one can also simply *re-raise* an existing exception from an
`except` block with a bare `raise` statement.


**Fail early and often** — when your code cannot continue safely, it's
better to raise an exception and give up. Calling code can then still
decide to handle the exception.


## Types of bugs ##

Bugs can be

* [syntax and language errors](#syntax-and-language) (easy, relatively
  speaking)
* input errors (not properly dealing with bad/wrong/unexpected input
  data): errors that raise exceptions under certain conditions
* [logic errors](#logic-errors), [edge cases](#edge-cases), corner cases (hard)

Here we provide an introduction to the absolutely necessary business
of identifying and fixing ("squashing") software bugs. Work through
this page and then see [More Resources](#more-resources) at the end
for more advanced material. Bug-hunting can be difficult and tedious
but you have to do it --- code that produces wrong results is useless.


## General strategy

1. Be clear about what your code *ought* to do: what are the inputs,
   what are the outputs? What do you *expect* to get?

2. If you get an *exception* with a *stack trace*: look at the code
   that is referenced.

3. Output intermediate values (e.g., `print()` calls). Compare what
   you get to what you expect. Run the program in your head to
   understand what values you should see.

4. Make one change and re-run. Is the bug fixed? If not, repeat.


## Helpful strategies

* Have a terminal and an editor open, side by side, so that you can
  quickly run the modified code. (Don't forget to save changes before
  running the code...)

* Prototype small code pieces interactively in `ipython`.

* Modularize code (functions, classes, modules) and test individual
  pieces of code.

* Run programs inside `ipython` using the `%run` magic function:

  ```python
  %run hello.py
  ```
  
  The advantage is that now you can *examine variables interactively*
  inside the interpreter.[^1]

* Learn to use the [Python debugger in
  ipython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html#using-the-python-debugger-pdb)
  (enable with `%pdb` in ipython).

## <span class="label" style="background: black">Activity</span> Fix as many bugs as possible!

Code for the examples below comes in a Classroom Activity (set-up link
provided in the Canvas LMS). [^0]


### Syntax and language

#### Bug 1
Print the numbers 0 to 9:
{% highlight python %}
fro num in range(10):
    print(num)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bug 2
Print the squares of the numbers 0 to 9:
{% highlight python %}
for num in range(10):
    x = num**2
     print(x)
print("Done") 
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bug 3
Print "error" for input 0 or the inverse of the input number:
{% highlight python %}
x = input("Enter non-zero number --> ")
if x = 0:
   print("ERROR: number cannot be 0")
else:
   inverse = 1/x
   print(inverse)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bug 4
Define the sinc-function $$\mathrm{sinc}(x) = \sin(x)/x$$:
{% highlight python %}
def sinc(x):
   return sin(x)/x

print(sinc(3.145))
{% endhighlight %}

### Slicing and list building

A common problem is getting the indexing wrong, resulting in
`IndexError` or subtle errors in the lists themselves. If faced with
slicing problems, try to build and slice lists interactively in
`ipython` and then transfer the working slice recipe to your code. You
sometimes may want to create a simpler or shorter list for testing.

#### Bug 5
Show that my favorite season in Arizona is winter:

{% highlight python %}
seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']
print('My favorite season is ', seasons[4])
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bug 6
Create a list of values -10, -9.8, -9.6, ..., -0.2, 0, 0.2, ..., 10.

{% highlight python %}
h = 0.2
x = [-10 + i*h for i in range(100)]
{% endhighlight %}


### Edge cases

*Edge cases* occur at the boundaries of the allowed range of input;
typically, you have to test them explicitly. (*Corner cases* occur
when multiple edge cases come together.)

#### Bug 7
The sinc function is defined for all real numbers
{% highlight python %}
import math
def sinc(x):
   return math.sin(x)/x
{% endhighlight %}

but this implementation is incomplete.

1. find values for which our function does not produce the correct
   result
2. fix it
3. BONUS: plot `sinc(x)` for values from -10 to 10 in steps of 0.2. 



### Logic errors

*Logic errors* tend to be the worst because your code runs and might
even produce output that looks roughly correct even though it is
wrong. You find logic errors by having a good understanding of what
your code should produce for a given input and then trying different
inputs and following the input through the code.

#### Bug 8
Create a list of squares of the first 10 natural numbers (0, 1,
2, ..., 10) and print their sum [^2]:
{% highlight python %}
squares = []
s = 0
for n in range(1, 10):
   squares.append(s)
   s = n*n
   print(n, s)

sum_s = sum(squares)
print("sum of squares", sum_s)

# result should be 385
{% endhighlight %}

#### Bug 9
Calculate the position of an object in free fall as a function of time
and store time points (in 1-s intervals) and positions in two arrays
(for plotting):[^3]

{% highlight python %}
g = -9.81
t, h, tmax = 1., 0., 10.

times, positions = [], []
while t <= tmax:
   x = 0.5 * g * t * t
   times.append(t)
   positions.append(x)
   t += h

print(times)
print(values)
{% endhighlight %}
